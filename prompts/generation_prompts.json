    "prompt1": "Graph Connection Relationship Standardization Guide\nBackground and Objective\nYou need to convert various types of diagram descriptions (including system block diagrams, basic circuit diagrams, flowcharts, digital logic circuit diagrams, and general circuit diagrams) into a standardized connection relationship representation format. This will help establish a unified method for representing connections, enabling models to learn a broader paradigm of connection relationships.\nInput Requirements\nPlease provide the diagram description you want to convert, which can be a textual description or an explanation of an existing diagram.\nOutput Format\nPlease convert your diagram description according to the following standard format:\nmaingraph [GraphName1]\n    [ComponentA] --> [ComponentB]\n    [ComponentC] -- [ComponentD]\n    [ComponentE] <--> [ComponentF]\n    [ComponentG] --> [ComponentH][\"label\"=\"ConnectionLabel\"]\n    subgraph [SubgraphName1]\n        [ComponentI] --> [ComponentJ]\n        [ComponentK] --> [ComponentL]\n    end\n    subgraph [SubgraphName2]\n        [ComponentM] --> [ComponentN]\n    end\nmaingraph [GraphName2]\n    [ComponentO] --> [ComponentP]\n    [ComponentQ] --> [ComponentR]\nHierarchical_Relationship\n    [GraphName1] --> [GraphName2]\n    [ComponentA] --> [GraphName2]\n    [SubgraphName1] --> [GraphName2]\n\nSeries_Simplification\n    [Text description of omitted series connections]\n\nParallel_Simplification\n    [Text description of omitted parallel connections]\n\nFormat Explanation\n1. Connection Representation:\n   1. Single arrow (directed connection): -->\n   2. No arrow (undirected connection): --\n   3. Double arrow (bidirectional connection): <-->\n   4. Labeled connection: [ComponentA] --> [ComponentB][\"label\"=\"ConnectionLabelText\"]\n2. Graph Hierarchy Structure:\n   1. maingraph: Represents an independent connection relationship diagram\n   2. subgraph: Represents a submodule within a maingraph, using indentation to show hierarchical relationships\n   3. All subgraphs must end with the end keyword\n3. Relationship Descriptions:\n   1. Hierarchical_Relationship: Describes all parent-child relationships\n   2. Series_Simplification: Describes all omitted series connections\n   3. Parallel_Simplification: Describes all omitted parallel connections\n\nSimplification Rules\n1. Series Simplification:\n   1. First, list all visible connection relationships in the diagram\n   2. Then, use natural language to describe the omitted elements and the number of omissions\n2. Parallel Simplification:\n   1. First, list all visible connection relationships in the diagram\n   2. Then, use natural language to describe the omitted elements and the number of omissions\n\nExample\nIf you have the following description: \"The voltage controller output connects to the current converter, which then connects to the comparator and control unit with a feedback label\"\nIt should be converted to:\n\nmaingraph VoltageControlSystem\n    Voltage_Controller --> Current_Converter\n    Current_Converter --> Comparator\n    Current_Converter --> Control_Unit[\"label\"=\"feedback\"]\n\nPlease standardize your diagram connection relationships according to the above format.",
    
    "prompt2": "Describe the compltet connections layout of this network diagram.",
    
    "prompt3": "Identify all network connections shown in this diagram and convert them to the standardized format. Use the appropriate arrow type for each connection:\n- Single arrow (-->) for directed connections\n- No arrow (--) for undirected connections\n- Double arrow (<-->) for bidirectional connections\n\nFor connections with labels, use the format: [ComponentA] --> [ComponentB][\"label\"=\"ConnectionLabelText\"]",
    
    "prompt4": "Please extract and structure all connection relationships from this diagram. Begin with 'maingraph' and list all connections using the appropriate symbols:\n- --> for directed connections\n- -- for undirected connections\n- <--> for bidirectional connections\n\nIf a connection has a label, represent it as: [Component1] --> [Component2][\"label\"=\"label_text\"]",

    "prompt5": "Document this diagram's connectivity using the standard format.",

    "prompt6": "Using the standard syntax, map out the nodes, edges, and any subgraph structures from this circuit diagram. Include explicit sections for hierarchy and textual descriptions of simplifications."
